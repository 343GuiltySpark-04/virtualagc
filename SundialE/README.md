The file SundialE.bin contains data dumped from physical fixed-memory modules from the AGC owned by the MIT Museum.  The dump was performed using the restored AGC owned by collector Jimmie Loocke in July 2019.

Source code will become available as it becomes available via regeneration from related programs and disassembly.

Identification of this AGC is based on circumstantial evidence, because the AGC itself has no part tag.  The observable facts are that the AGC contains:

1. "B" tray of type [2003075]-031
2. Alarm module of type 2003890
3. Fixed-memory modules B1 (p/n 2003053-121), B2 (p/n 2003053-151), B3 (p/n 2003972-211)

On the _available_ information -- and admitting that there may be AGC units not covered by the available information -- this would seem to narrow the AGC p/n to either 2003100-071 (of which the only known example is the restoration AGC mentioned above) or else to 2003100-061, and possibly the following one:

* From CSM-098, "2VT-1"
* AGC p/n 2003100-061
* Software SUNDIAL 2021104-041

Cross-check: while we do not have drawing 2021104-041, we do have the following drawings:

* 2003053N, which indicates that the parent drawing of both 2003053-121 and -151 is 2021104
* 2003972AE, which indicates at the parent drawing of 2003972-211 is 2021104-041
