The file SundialE.bin contains data dumped from physical fixed-memory modules from the AGC owned by the MIT Museum.  The dump was performed using the restored AGC owned by collector Jimmie Loocke in July 2019.

Source code will become available eventually, via regeneration from related programs and disassembly.

Identification of this AGC is based on circumstantial evidence, because the AGC itself has no part tag.  The observable facts are that the AGC contains:

1. "B" tray of type 2003075-031
2. Alarm module of type 2003890
3. Fixed-memory modules B1 (p/n 2003053-121), B2 (p/n 2003053-151), B3 (p/n 2003972-211)

On the available information -- and admitting that there may be AGC units not covered by the available information -- this would seem to narrow the AGC p/n to 2003100-061, and possibly the following specific AGC:

* From CSM-098, "2VT-1"
* AGC p/n 2003100-061
* Software SUNDIAL D, 2021104-041

The only known discrepancy is that the fixed-memory modules listed are known to be from SUNDIAL assembly 2021104-051, SUNDIAL E.  However, SUNDIAL D and SUNDIAL E actually have identical core-rope contents, and it is therefore possible that SUNDIAL D fixed-memory modules were swapped with SUNDIAL E modules at some point, without affecting functionality in any way.
