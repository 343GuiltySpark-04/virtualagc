C/ For a parallelogram, you input the length of the long side, the short side,
C/ and the angle between them (in radians).  It then computes the positions
C/ of the 4 corners on the assumption that a short side and long side meet
C/ at the origin, that the long side proceeds in the + direction along the 
C/ x-axis, and that the parallelogram is in the upper-right quadrant.
