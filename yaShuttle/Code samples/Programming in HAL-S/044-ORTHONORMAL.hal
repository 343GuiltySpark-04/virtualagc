C/ This sample is from PDF p. 44 of "Programming in HAL/S".  The code listed 
C/ there is the output from the original assembler ... which is valid source
C/ code, true, but not actually in the form somebody likely inputted it  
C/ using punchcards.  (Recall that the assembler created a listing file that 
C/ had essentially been pretty-printed, without any regard to the actual
C/ format of the input.)  I've restored it to something probably closer to
C/ what was on the original punchcards.
