# From PDF p. 76 of "Programming in HAL/S".

# This code sample fails in the demo compiler front-end as of 2022-11-19.
# It fails with syntax error at TRUE in line 10. It succeeds line
# 10 is changed from Q1 = TRUE to TRUE = Q1.  I suspect that for some
# reason it misidentifies Q1 as an <ARITH ID> rather than a <BIT ID>.
# I'll have to come back to this and fix it at some point.
