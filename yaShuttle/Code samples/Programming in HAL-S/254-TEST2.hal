C/ Adapted from PDF p. 254 of "Programming in HAL/S".
C/ The original code could not be compiled, because
C/ it didn't consist of top-level blocks like PROGRAM,
C/ FUNCTION, or PROCEDURE.  I've simply wrapped the 
C/ whole thing in a PROGRAM block to make it compilable.

  TEST2:
  PROGRAM;

     DECLARE I INTEGER,
             B BIT(16);
     READ(5) I;
E    .
M    B = BIT(I);
E       .
M    IF B  THEN   
S	 1

        WRITE(6) 'VALUE OF I WAS NEGATIVE';
E       .
M    IF B  THEN
S        #

        WRITE(6) 'VALUE OF I WAS ODD';
      
  CLOSE TEST2;
