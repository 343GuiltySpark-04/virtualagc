C/ Adapted from PDF p. 264 of "Programming in HAL/S".
C/ The original code could not be compiled, because
C/ it didn't consist of top-level blocks like PROGRAM,
C/ FUNCTION, or PROCEDURE.  I've simply wrapped the 
C/ whole thing in a PROGRAM block to make it compilable.

  PROGRAM;

     DECLARE TQ TQE-STRUCTURE(100);
