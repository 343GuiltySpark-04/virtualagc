# This sample code is from PDF p. 72 of "Programming in HAL/S".
# It illustrates the use of TEMPORARY variables, which are variables
# defined within a DO ... END block rather than in the main 
# declaration group.  Since this sample doesn't output anything,
# there's not actually much point in running it.  It's mainly for
# testing the compiler.

     DECLARE 	VEL VECTOR,

     DO;
     	TEMPORARY V_PRIME VECTOR;
     	V_PRIME = MY_FRAME VEL;
     	RESULT1 = UNIT(V_PRIME);
     	RESULT2 = V_PRIME * E;
