C/ Adapted from PDF p. 254 of "Programming in HAL/S".
C/ The original code could not be compiled, because
C/ it didn't consist of top-level blocks like PROGRAM,
C/ FUNCTION, or PROCEDURE.  I've simply wrapped the 
C/ whole thing in a PROGRAM block to make it compilable.

  TEST1:
  PROGRAM;

     DECLARE INPUT BIT(24);
     DECLARE OUTPUT INTEGER INITIAL(0);
     DO FOR I = 1 TO 21 BY 4;
E                                     .
M       OUTPUT = 10 OUTPUT + INTEGER(INPUT      );
S					  4 AT I

     END;
  CLOSE TEST1;
