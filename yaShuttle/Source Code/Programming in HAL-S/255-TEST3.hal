C/ Adapted from PDF p. 255 of "Programming in HAL/S".
C/ The original code could not be compiled, because
C/ it didn't consist of top-level blocks like PROGRAM,
C/ FUNCTION, or PROCEDURE.  I've simply wrapped the 
C/ whole thing in a PROGRAM block to make it compilable.

  TEST3:
  PROGRAM;

     DECLARE B BIT(8);
E    .
M    B = BIT(25);
E                           .
M    WRITE(6) CHARACTER    (B);
S                      @HEX

E                           .
M    WRITE(6) CHARACTER    (B);
S                      @DEC

E                           .
M    WRITE(6) CHARACTER    (B);
S                      @OCT

E                           .
M    WRITE(6) CHARACTER    (B);
S                      @BIN

E            .
M   WRITE(6) B;
