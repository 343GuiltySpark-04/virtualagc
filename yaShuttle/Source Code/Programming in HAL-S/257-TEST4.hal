C/ Adapted from PDF p. 257 of "Programming in HAL/S".  Enclosing brackets
C/ have been removed from array variables, because they are not legal syntax.
C/ As originally divided up in the book, the lines are in fact too long for
C/ the original HAL/S compiler.  Rather than worrying about how to split up 
C/ multiline (E/M/S) code into shorter lines, I've flattened the code into the 
C/ single-line format. (Unintentionally making it far easier to comprehend.
C/ Oops!  My bad!)
