C/ Adapted from PDF p. 260 of "Programming in HAL/S".
C/ The original code could not be compiled, because
C/ it didn't consist of top-level blocks like PROGRAM,
C/ FUNCTION, or PROCEDURE.  I've simply wrapped the 
C/ whole thing in a PROGRAM block to make it compilable.

  TEST5:
  PROGRAM;

E                        +
M    CALL XTRA ASSIGN(IMU_INPT     );

  XTRA:
  PROCEDURE ASSIGN(BEST_IMU);
     DECLARE BEST_IMU IMU_DATA-STRUCTURE;

M    PITCH_ANGLE = SCALAR(BEST_IMU.ATTITUDE  );
S					   1
