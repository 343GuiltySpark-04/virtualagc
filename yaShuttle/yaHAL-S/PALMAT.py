# The code generator (ast -> PALMAT).

'''
Here's the idea:  generatePALMAT() is a recursive function that works its
way through the given AST to generate PALMAT for it.

Potentially we have (in the p_Functions module) a Python function associated
with each unique LBNF label, and what that function does is to perform whatever
PALMAT generation is needed for that rul. The function names and LBNF labels 
are the identical.  (Actually, the labels all begin with two alphabetic capital 
letters that can be discared, so the leading two upper-case characters are 
removed from the function names.)

As generatePALMAT() descends through the AST, it simply calls the functions
associated with the labels, *if* they exist in the p_Functions module.  For 
example, when the label "AAdeclareBody_declarationList" is encountered in the 
AST structure, the function named "declareBody_declarationList" exists (and is
called), whereas when the label "AAdeclarationList" is encountered, there is
no function named "declarationList which can be called and thus no PALMAT
generation occurs.

As far as the details of how to call a function when we are given its name as
a string, the basic notion is that the function can be found by looking up the
string in the globals() dictionary.  In our case, we need to do the lookup in 
globals() of the p_Functions module, and not of this PALMAT module.  But 
p_Functions's globals() is provided to us as p_Functions.objects.  Here's what 
the whole thing looks like:
    import p_Functions
    ...
    func = p_Functions.objects["declareBody_declarationList"]
    ret = func()
(The arguments and return value of func mightn't be what's shown; I'm just 
talking about the principle of how to look up the function and call it.)  

The generatePALMAT() function is basically a (pretty-complex) state machine,
and therefore must track the state in order to figure out how to interpret some
of the stuff it finds in the AST.  That's tricky, because the state generally
depends not just on the current LBNF label being processed, but on some 
(abridged) sequence of LBNF labels.  For example, in processing
    DECLARE A INTEGER DOUBLE;
            vs
    DECLARE INTEGER, A DOUBLE;
the INTEGER keyword has to be handle somewhat differently.  The solution I use
to track the states is that the "state" includes (among other things} a list 
of the form
    [LBNFlabel1, ..., LBNFlabelN]
where (as I said) these LBNF labels are some abridged sequence of the LBNF
labels encountered.  I call this list the "history".  The entry state in 
which no statement is yet being processed is state={ "history" : [] }.
